## Laboratory
Laboratory 1 : Image segmentation  


Laboratory 2 : Object description   


Laboratory 3 : Image classification   

## Special Project
Equation elements classification by tracking robot position
### Principle
Track the position of a robot in each frame of a 2 FPS input video. Each time a the robot passes through an equation element, the element is sent in a classifier to recognize it and added to the equation. At the end of the sequence display the result of the equation.
